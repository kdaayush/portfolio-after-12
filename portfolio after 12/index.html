        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about_me"> Allow me to introduce myself : I'm AYUSH KUMAR DWIBEDI,
            a dedicated undergradute student with an unbridled enthusiasm for learning and exploration.
            Has compeleted schooling up to class 10 from Gautam Secondary School: Birgunj,nepal ; and compeleted my 10+2 
            from Prasadi Academy: Kathmandu,Nepal. Currently navigating the halls of SRMIST KTR,Chennai;India Taking computer 
            science and engineering as major for my bachelors degree. 
            I find immense joy in diving deep into the world of academia and beyond.
            Academically, I've found a particular passion for Physics and Maths where I
            consistently strive for excellence.
            My commitment to education extends beyond the classroom, 
            as evidenced by my active involvement in Interact Club of Kathmandu. Was involved in
            interact club of kathmandu since June 2022 to August 2024. That was a really great learning  
            and working experience. Whether collaborating with peers on projects or taking the lead in as an active
            member, I relish every opportunity to contribute to the vibrant tapestry of life. 
            Outside of the academic realm, my interests include sports that are cricket and basketball, 
            where I find solace and inspiration.   As I embark on this exciting journey through everything,
            I am eager to embrace the challenges and opportunities that come my way, confident in my ability to grow, 
            learn, and make a positive impact.</p>
